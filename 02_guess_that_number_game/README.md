# App 2: Guess my number game

Key concepts introduced
=================

**String formatting using f-strings**

`f"Your number was {num}."`

**Conditionals**

    if TEST:
        conditional code
        conditional code
    elif TEST:
        conditional code
    else:
        conditional code
        
**Loops**

    while TEST:
        loop code
        loop code
        loop code

**importing modules**

    import os
    print(os.sys.version)
    
**random numbers**

Random numbers are generated using the `randint()` method in the random module. You'll need to import random, and then call `random.randint(low, high)`.


**Truthiness**

    False # false is false 
    [] # empty lists / arrays are false 
    {} # empty dictionaries are false 
    "" # empty strings are false 
    0  # zero ints are false 
    0.0 # zero folast are false 
    None # Non / null / nil pointers are false 
    Everything else it true!
